  "about-text": "I really enjoyed developing Sight-Check for over a year and helping so many people! As you can see I decided not to include advertisements or fees, because healthcare should be free for you! \n\nThat's why I open-sourced the code, which means the code is free for everyone to use and explore. Follow Sight-Check on Instagram to suggest features or participate in making Sight-Check better, by visiting our project at Github.",
